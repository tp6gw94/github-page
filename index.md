# Emanote Template

This is a sample repository of Markdown notes, rendered using [Emanote] and hosted on [[GitHub Pages]], while enabling editing in the likes of [Visual Studio Code](https://emanote.srid.ca/start/resources/editors/vscode). For details, see https://github.com/srid/emanote-template.

Quick tips:

- Any `.md` file (eg: "[[GitHub Pages]]") or directory of `.md` files (eg: "[[Tutorials]]") you add to the repository will be rendered automatically. 
- Replace `.com` in the URL with `.dev`, to edit these notes in Visual Studio Code for Web.

For information on all features Emanote supports, see [the documentation][Emanote].
